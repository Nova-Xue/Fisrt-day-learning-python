Actually I started yesterday but I did not realised that I can use github as a recorder
I learned java before I was about to graduate from my college in a trainning institution 
It is like a coding camp teaching students near my university whose majors are more or less realted to IT
My java teacher was great and he somehow became a life tutor for me
But the one who checked my jsp project as a graduation result from that camp ruined my passion
I know there is still a willingness inside me to pursue a IT career for I chose my major as Communication Engieering with a passion
And I stick to it til now
I have arrived in America for 3 months and been eager to start a new life since then
I have been struggling among the choices
1.fing a job to support my own life
2.go to college again to learn Computer Science from the beginning
3.apply for graduate school
But I guess, at least, I have to start to do something first rather than just thinking about the unknown future
Then I decided to learn python on my own as I have wanted to since I learned Java



I learned some C in my university and nearly all the basic of Java
So python seemed quit easy to start with
I am using "Learning Python 3 the Hard Way"
And I finished the first 12 excerises yesterday
Here are some that I learned

variables names use underscore like "space_in_a_car = 4.0" 
and  {} to qoute variables like print(f"Let`s talk about {my_name}.")
f here is used to format string 
and there is .format() as well


use """ """ to print multiple lines or ''' '''
\n for new line (called backslash)
to print "\" use "\\"
and "\`" for "`" etc
\t for TAB


print("how old r u ",end = ' ')
age = input()

or

age = input("how old r y ")
