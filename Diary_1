Today, for the first time in the past three months
I finally feel that I start to fit in.
I am almost moved to tears for two guys
one of them came to greet me and said that he liked my shirt
the other ran across me and said "That shirt!" to me
It is a rick-and-morty shirt.
And thanks to this 'We are one' event
I finally feel fearless for my future life here in America
and I am no more hopelees with myself
I saw the possibility and the freedom that I dreamed of
And I know for sure now 
This is the life I want and this is my life
